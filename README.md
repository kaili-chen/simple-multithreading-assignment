# simple-multithreading-assignment

IDEA
- simple system for a pharmacy
- each pharmacy counter has its own thread (multi-threading)
- keep common inventory count of each medicine (race condition)
- has an inventory mgmt system to send alert when medicine is running low and may require replenishment soon
