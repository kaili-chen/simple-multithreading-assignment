To Run:
1. run 'compile.bat'
2. run 'run.bat': this will start the server and 2 clients in new command prompt windows
3. run 'start_client.bat' to add more clients to the currently running server

Notes:
- the server will be started on port 9999
- the command prompt window running the server will have a grey background for higher ease in differenciation 

To run the server and clients seperately:
1. run 'start_server.bat'
2. in a new command prompt window, run 'start_client.bat'
** 'start_server.bat' must be run first
